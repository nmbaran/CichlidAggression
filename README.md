This repository contains the input files and R scripts underlying the analysis for Baran & Streelman, 2020 (under review)

The R code file uses the three csv files. 

In addition, the UMDA2a_MergedKey provides the key to link the gene identifier (e.g. MSTRG.5811) to the gene name, genomic position, etc.
